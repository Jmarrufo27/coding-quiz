## this is a basic javascript coding quiz 
that you begin by clicking a START button that then starts a timer and takes questions and answer options 
from an array of objects in the script.js file and prints the question to the page and prints the answer
options into button. If the user gets the answer correct 50pts will be added to the score and move 
to the next question, but if the answer is wrong the game will deduct time from the timer then move to the 
next question. If the user finishes the quiz questions before the time limit or the time runs out the user
will be prompted to input their initials to save their score in a leaderboard that saves the initials and 
score in local storage so the user can refresh and play again.
